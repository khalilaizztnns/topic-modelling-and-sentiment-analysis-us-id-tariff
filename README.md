# Topic-Level Sentiment Analysis of the 32% U.S. Import Tariff Policy on Indonesia Using a BERT-Based Approach
Using data scraped via the YouTube Data API v3 from the comment section of the video “Digebuk Tarif 32% Trump! Ekonomi Indonesia Bisa Jeblok?” uploaded by the Metro TV channel, topic-level sentiment analysis was conducted. BERTopic was applied for topic modeling to group comments into specific topics, and XLM-RoBERTa was used for zero-shot sentiment classification to categorize each comment as either positive or negative. The goal was to examine the sentiment distribution, positive and negative, within each identified topic.
